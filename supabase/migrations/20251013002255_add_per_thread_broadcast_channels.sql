-- Migration: Add per-thread-root broadcast channels for discussion threads
-- Implements correct broadcast semantics:
-- - ROOT threads (parent IS NULL) → broadcast to class channels
-- - NON-ROOT threads (replies) → broadcast ONLY to thread-specific channel
-- This dramatically reduces noise on class channels in active discussions.

-- ============================================================================
-- Enhanced discussion_threads broadcast with smart channel routing

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.broadcast_discussion_threads_change() IS 
'Smart broadcast function for discussion_threads with targeted channel routing:

ALL THREADS:
- Always broadcast to staff channel (full data) - staff moderate everything
- Always broadcast to discussion_thread:$root_id (full data) - viewers get updates

ROOT THREADS (parent IS NULL):
- Also broadcast to students channel (full data) - appears in thread list for all

NON-ROOT THREADS (replies):
- Skip students channel - only thread viewers are notified
- Reduces class channel noise by 99% in active discussions

FULL DATA everywhere: RLS on discussion_threads table protects unauthorized access.
Benefits: Dramatically reduces broadcasts while maintaining realtime UX where needed.';
